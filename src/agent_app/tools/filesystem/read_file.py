    "assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; "
    "an error will be returned\n"
    "- By default, reads up to 2000 lines from the beginning of the file\n"
    "- For large files and codebase exploration, use pagination with offset and limit: "
    "read_file(path, limit=100) to see file structure, "
    "then read_file(path, offset=100, limit=200) for the next section\n"
    "- Results are returned in cat -n format (line_number + tab + content) "
    "with a header showing total lines and position\n"
    "- You should ALWAYS read a file before editing it\n"
    "- It is better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch when exploring a codebase\n"
    "- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents, "
